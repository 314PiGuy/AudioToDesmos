Convert sounds(Only piano unfortunately) into desmos frequency functions

Uses the madmom python library too track notes from a piano audio and then turns them into a playable desmos graph. It only works well with a single piano melody.

In the main.py script in the python folder change wav_path to the path of a wave file. Run the python script, and once it finishes download output.txt. Open index.html in the frontend folder in a web browser and click choose file. Select the output.txt file. Unmute the desmos volume to hear the graph.
